# MuchMore-project
This dataset consists of abstracts from medical scientific publications, covering various fields such as Cardiology, Ophthalmology, etc. Therefore, we are dealing with a multiclass classification problem (assigning a single possible class to a document). The category to which a document belongs corresponds to the first part of its name.

From this dataset, we will:

* Propose an exploratory data analysis.
* Present and comment on some relevant visualizations and metrics.
* Compare the performance of two approaches for document classification:
    * Linear SVM
    * Naive Bayes
* Propose an interactive exploration of the data and results.
