        This dataset consists of abstracts from medical scientific publications, 
        covering various fields such as Cardiology, Ophthalmology, etc. Therefore,
        we are dealing with a multiclass classification problem (assigning a single 
        possible class to a document). The category to which a document belongs 
        corresponds to the first part of its name.

        **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a page from the sidebar** to see the dashboard
        or to play with the interactive exploration of data !
